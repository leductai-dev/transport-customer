experiments:
- try to use HOC's, A higher-order component (HOC) is an advanced technique in React for reusing component logic.
- Profiler - The Profiler measures how often a React application renders and what the “cost” of rendering is. Its purpose is to help identify parts of an application that are slow and may benefit from optimizations such as memoization.
- custom hook - Building your own Hooks lets you extract component logic into reusable functions.
- Jest, Test Library (not required)
